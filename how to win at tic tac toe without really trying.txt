if it's AI's turn:
For each cell in tic tac toe matrix:	
	if cell is empty or is opponents:
		Look at all neighbors (however we do that, either with a node & directional vector schema or a coordinate system) 
		find every 3 element vector (a vector should have a this object and two other objects; position does not matter, each should be either labeled as AI, Opponent, or empty)
		run vector through count function 
			switch:
				if selecting this causes a win
					return W
				else if not selecting causes a lose
					return L
				else
					return number of unobstructed rows from that position
	if a vector causes a win:
		just take it oh my god why even wait
	else if a vector causes opponent to win:
		block that shit wtf
	else
		take the vector	with the highest win count and select it's this object. Ties can be randomly resolved or just take fist.
Wait for next turn.
